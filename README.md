# RE:BUILD

## C.H.I.P Music Player

Your task is to turn the C.H.I.P into versatile music center. Integrate into services like Spotify and SMB. Make it to play songs from the local filesystem also.
Integrate the provided remote controller to control the music. Add 16x2 LCD screen to display information such as "now playing". 

Optionally you can also implement an API for controlling the music, and then provide some sort of user interface with controls and authentication.
Add more functionalities and music services if you have the time!

Focus on:
- Integrating succesfully multiple music services, such as Spotify
- Implement easy to use controls for users with basic functionalities
- Making the system secure
- Good documentation for users who want to setup similar system
