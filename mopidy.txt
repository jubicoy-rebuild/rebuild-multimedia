We installed Gmusic and Youtube extensions with
sudo pip install mopidy-gmusic mopidy-youtube
sudo pip --upgrade install pyasn1

For gmusic you need a username and password in ~/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf:
[gmusic]
username = un
password = pw

To bind to all interfaces you have to edit the bind address to 0.0.0.0 in the
mopidy.conf

For a frontend we installed moped with
sudo pip install Mopidy-Moped

Run mopidy with "mopidy" and you can access the UI from http://192.168.0.22:6680/moped/
